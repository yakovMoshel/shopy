# Ayala Cakes - Portfolio and Order Management System

### Overview

**Ayala Cakes** is a sophisticated online portfolio and order management system designed specifically for a professional confectioner. This Full-Stack project allows customers to browse through a visually appealing catalog of unique and custom-made cakes, view detailed product descriptions, and place orders directly on the site. In addition to customer-facing features, the platform includes a comprehensive admin dashboard that enables the confectioner to manage every aspect of their business online.

This entire project was crafted with a clean and intuitive UX/UI design, built completely from scratch without the use of any pre-made components. Every element was carefully designed and developed to meet the specific needs of the project, ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Key Features
